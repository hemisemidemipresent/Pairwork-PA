Proj:
I'd say that on card click, we can probably do a thing very similar to the ICA, right?
Preferably we also make a "return to previous screen button" right there as well, without needing to click at the top left corner? For convenience, that is.
To be honest I think that it's better for us not to cram the initial card with details.
Instead, we can just put all the necessary information in the after screen. (Maybe we can keep the image, name, and price, and leave the rest to the next screen.)

For customer reviews, do you also want to do a similar card thing?
It feels like the organisation can work in a very similar way ~~so we can just copy the code over~~
And yes, the new user sign-up part isn't hard, I guess? It's just Y3 CS stuff I assume.

yea sure, we can go with that

Yeah I was thinking, card displays name and description, but now I think name and price is more suitable, then put the description at the end

yeah we can just copy-paste it over

File IO in here is quite a bit harder I think
