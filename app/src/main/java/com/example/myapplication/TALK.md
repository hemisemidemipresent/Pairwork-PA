Project-Account62:

I'd say that on card click, we can probably do a thing very similar to the ICA, right?

Preferably we also make a "return to previous screen button" right there as well, without needing to click at the top left corner? For convenience, that is.

To be honest I think that it's better for us not to cram the initial card with details.

Instead, we can just put all the necessary information in the after screen. (Maybe we can keep the image, name, and price, and leave the rest to the next screen.)


For customer reviews, do you also want to do a similar card thing?

It feels like the organisation can work in a very similar way ~~so we can just copy the code over~~

And yes, the new user sign-up part isn't hard, I guess? It's just Y3 CS stuff I assume.

yea sure, we can go with that

Yeah I was thinking, card displays name and description, but now I think name and price is more suitable, then put the description at the end

> For customer reviews, do you also want to do a similar card thing?

yeah we can just copy-paste it over

File IO in here is quite a bit harder I think

Yea I meant the regex stuff lol

-- ok I just added my ICA code lol, i guess we need to fix it up so it looks nicer ðŸ¤”
-- so like, after we fix up the cards, then we can go on to work on the rest of the thing, esp the ui
-- do you want anything else in terms of design? other than the functionality

no not really

TODO:

1. [x] When the user opens the app, he / she is not expected to perform any login and will see
the catalog immediately.

2. [x] The SuperVend catalog needs to be scrollable and the items need to be placed in the
form of cards.

3. [ ] When the user selects any item from the catalog, details of the item will be displayed to
the user (item category, price, product, storage temperature if relevant)

4. [ ] A short description about the SuperVend to attract customers need to be accessible in
the app

5. [ ] Contact information regarding SuperVend needs to be present for the user to contact.

6. [ ] A list of customer reviews should be present in the app. The user should be able to add
a review to the list of reviews. 

7. [ ] An option should be present for the user to sign up as a new user to SuperVend. Relevant
checks need to be done to ensure the user enters a valid username and password.

I have put 4. 5. 6. in the menu, functionality to be implemented
