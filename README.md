#### CS 4131 Mobile Application Development Pairwork Programming Assignment

### Task Description:

As part of your CS3233 module, you have created the SuperVend desktop app and the
stakeholders of SuperVend were impressed with your desktop app and wish for you to create an
accompanying mobile app to view the SuperVend catalog to attract new customers. The
stakeholders have also decided to pair you up with a teammate who is familiar with the
SuperVend desktop app as well.

Based on the above description, note that this PA is strictly to be done as a two-person team
and it will be up to the team to allocate the workload fairly.

The stakeholders decided to give you free reign to design the app as you wish, however, there
are certain minimum requirements the app must fulfill:

- When the user opens the app, he / she is not expected to perform any login and will see
    the catalog immediately.
- The SuperVend catalog needs to be scrollable and the items need to be placed in the
    form of cards.
- When the user selects any item from the catalog, details of the item will be displayed to
    the user (item category, price, product, storage temperature if relevant)
- A short description about the SuperVend to attract customers need to be accessible in
    the app
- Contact information regarding SuperVend needs to be present for the user to contact.
- A list of customer reviews should be present in the app. The user should be able to add
    a review to the list of reviews.
- An option should be present for the user to sign up as a new user to SuperVend. Relevant
    checks need to be done to ensure the user enters a valid username and password.

Note that:

- You are allowed to hardcode a sample of the data into the app to showcase its
    functionality. As for the images of the items, you may use the same
- You are not expected to do any file IO in the app.
- The UI should not be cluttered, and must be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. You
    may consider using tabs and make good and appropriate use of overflow menus, the
    action bar and the FAB.
- You should make good use of the Toast, Snackbar and dialogs to keep the user informed
    of any errors or any progress through the runtime of the app.
- Your app should display good knowledge of event-handling and the use of the
    ConstraintLayout as well.
- You are given free reign to design the app how you wish and add on any features which
    will value-add to the purpose of the app, as long as the minimum requirements of the app.
- You are encouraged to explore further beyond the syllabus or what is taught in class to
    implement the features in your app.
